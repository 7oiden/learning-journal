                            <h1>Hi There! My name is Tommy and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                            <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big
                                jump
                                over
                                the the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded
                                peers.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
                                learning,
                                then
                                try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                                projects. </p>
                            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most
                                things
                                about my journey with the world.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2>How I got started</h2>
                            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about
                                what I
                                was
                                learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I
                                learned
                                but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. </p>
                            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
                                summaries
                                was
                                also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
